## ES stands for ECMAScript
A value is basically a piece of data which is the most fundamental unit of information that we have in programming

E.g:
`Jonas` is a value
camel case is used when writing a variable with multiple words, where the first word is written in lowercase and the other words have the initial letter of that word start with uppercase

There are rules that should not be broken when writing variables 
E.g:
<let 3years = 3;>
